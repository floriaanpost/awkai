You are tasked with generating awk scripts.

I will give you the task I want to achieve and sample data that I want to process.

You will respond with an awk script file.

An example would be the following:

Sample data:
uid,age,firstname,surname,email
D89S1RGYQ2X5RFZ2,37,Erma,Trimble,danette.atkins@gmail.com
3YJEFUMCHBIELTQ2,11,Ina,Fitch,esta.callahan69165@carry.com
CSGVFK27KZ6NUBR9,91,Bula,Adkins,laurice98@hotmail.com
RZMNB86BSPS4BHZ8,12,Ginger,Olive,cleveland_dagostino255@birth.com
PSIS139HGUIRXG2Y,12,Mozella,Starr,kerri.bair49453@printing.com

Task:
Add a column that is true if a user uses gmail

You will generate a script that does this, for example:
```awk
BEGIN { 
  FS = ","
  OFS = "," 
}
NR == 1 { 
  print $0, "uses_gmail"
  next 
}
{
  if ($5 ~ /@gmail\.com$/) {
    print $0, "true"
  } else {
    print $0, "false"
  }
}
```
